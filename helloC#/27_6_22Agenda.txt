
1. .NET Framework:


	GC : 
		Automatic Memory Management 
		Garbage Collector works in two iterations

			Marks objects which are orphan objects ( unreference objects)
			Sweeps those marked objects from Heap

	Managed Heap: heap is managed by GC
	Managed Code: IL code,
		      Code execution is managed by CLR
	Managed Programming language: C#

		CLS: Common Language Specification
		CLR: Common Language Runtime
		CTS: Common Type System
		BCL: Base Class Library
		FCL: Framework Class Library
		GC:  Garbage Collector

		ADO.NET: ActiveX Data Objects
		ORM:Object Relational Mapping
		WPF: Windows Presentation Foundation
		WCF: Windows Communication Foundation ( Library for building Service Oriented Architecture Apps ( SOA))
		LINQ:Language Integrated Query ( LinQ)
		ASP.net: Active Server Pages .net
		MVC: Model View Controller
		API:Application Program Interface ( inbuilt mechanism to invoke functionality )


Assembly:
	a Logical unit of Deployment on .net platform
	is a collection of  exe and / or dll
		
	Exe: file or DLL file consit of  IL code
		
	Assembly consist of 

			PE Header: (Ported Executable)
				   Jump instruction  for Entry Point. (Main)
			CLR Header:			 
				    version of targtted .net runtime

			Manifest:	
				 infromation about assembly
						version of assembly
						Name of assembly
						copyright of assebmly
						Autor of Assebmly
						Security Policy information about Code (CAS) ( Code Access Security)
			Metadata:
				data about data
				data about IL code
				lot of information about IL types and attributes


			IL Code:
				 Intermediate Language Code

AppDomain:
	(Application Domain)
	.net execution context inside process

	 Managed Heap

	


C# Language Feature:

	1.Allow multiple classes to have Main as static function.
	2.Set information to manifest of assembly using Attribute in assemblyinfo.cs.
	3.Allow end user to submit information through command line at the start of exeuction of program
	4.Simple difference between readonly and const keyword in CSharp
	5.Operator Overloading
	6.Singleton Pattern
	7.Collection
	8.Arrays
		Single Dim

		Multi Dim
			Rectangular Array
			Jagged Array
